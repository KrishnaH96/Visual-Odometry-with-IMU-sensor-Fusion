# Visual-Odometry-with-IMU-sensor-Fusion

The purpose of this project is to explain the design, implementation,
and assessment of an OpenCV-based visual
odometry system using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
sensor data for improved accuracy. Visual odometry is an
essential approach in computer vision and robotics for anticipating
a cameraâ€™s location over time, which provides
critical information about the motions of a robot or vehicle.
This study provides an ORB feature recognition, frame-toframe
matching, fundamental matrix estimate, and position
recovery approach for tracking camera motion. In addition,
Kalman filtering techniques are used to include IMU data
and enhance posture predictions. The results indicate that
this approach can provide a reliable solution for real-time
camera pose estimation in the absence of GPS and other
location systems.
